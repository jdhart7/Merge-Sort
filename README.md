# Merge-Sort
This program creates an array filled with "randomly" generated numbers, then sorts them using the merge sort algorithm. The algorithm basically divides the array into smaller arrays that are easier to sort, then puts them back together (hence the term "divide and conquer" that refers to these type of algorithms). The algorithm is stored in a header file to make it modular in case I need it to sort anything else in the future.
